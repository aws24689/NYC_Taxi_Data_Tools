Scripts to assist in working with the publicly available NYC taxi datasets

There is a vast amount of information available from the NYC.gov website regarding cab rides from 2009-2013. This repo contains
tools and scripts that make it easier to work with this information. 

1 - Create_SQLite.r - Is a script which creates a SQLite database from a directory full of as many or as few of the CSV files 
available from this website: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml storing them in this format makes
them easier to work with and access. It also geocodes the data with neighborhood names allowing for easier visualization and data manipulation.


More to come.
